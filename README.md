![keep growing logo](readme-images/logo_250x60.png)

This project is a simple scaffolding for a Spring Boot application that uses Log4j 2 for logging and Elastic Stack for processing log entries.

## Getting Started

To clone the repository, run in the command line:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/little-pinecone/spring-boot-log4j-2-scaffolding.git
```

You can build the application with:
```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

### Spring security

The application uses [Spring Boot security starter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-security).
The default credentials are specified in the [application.properties](https://github.com/little-pinecone/spring-boot-log4j-2-scaffolding/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties) file:

* `Useranme` test
* `Password` test

### Monitoring Spring Boot with Actuator

After starting the Spring Boot app, you have to sign in:

![login form](readme-images/login-form.png)

Now you can browse the enabled and exposed [Actuator endpoints](http://localhost:8080/actuator): `info`, `health`, `metrics`.

### Run the Spring Boot app, Elastic Stack, Prometheus and Grafana

* Run this application to make sure that the `all.log` file is created and not empty (more than one line is required).
* Run the `$ docker-compose up -d` command in the project directory. The following services should be started:

```bash

```
* Visit `http://localhost:5000/#!/` to use ElastiHQ interface to verify the content send to Elasticsearch (run `Query` for the `spring-boot-app-logs-YYYY.MM.dd` index):

* Visit `http://localhost:5601/` to log in to Kibana:

![kibana-login-screenshot](readme-images/kibana-login-page.png)

* Use the default username: `elastic` and password: `test`.
* Create `index` defined in the `logstash.conf` file and browse logs accumulated in the `logs/all.log` file (the file is automatically created on the application startup):

![kibana-discover-screenshot](readme-images/kibana-discover.png)

* Visit `http://localhost:5601/app/monitoring` to check out clusters monitoring:

![stack-monitoring-screenshot](readme-images/clusters.png)

`Standalone cluster` shows metrics for Filebeat, `docker-cluster` displays metrics for Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash:

![docker-cluster-screenshot](readme-images/docker-cluster.png)

You can also monitor the application state using [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/?orgId=1):

## Overview and technical features

* [Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) is used for logs processing.
* The application uses the `root` logger and sends log entries to `RollingFile` and `Console` appenders (when you run the app, the `logs` directory will be created automatically).
* After log entries had been processed by Filebeat and Logstash, they are send to ElasticSearch.
* You can browse logs in [Kibana](http://localhost:5601/).
* You can browse Elastic Stack metrics in a [Kibana dashboard](http://localhost:5601/app/monitoring).
* You can monitor the Spring Boot app using [Actuator endpoints](http://localhost:8080/actuator).
* You can monitor the Spring Boot app using the [Prometheus](http://localhost:9090) or [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/) dashboards.
